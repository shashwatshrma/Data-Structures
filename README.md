********** DATA STRUCTURES PROJECT **********

This project implements and works with various data structures.
The following programs are included in this project:

- linked_list.c
	+ This program implements the basic operations of a linked list:
	- Searching: Implemented using the search function, returns the index of the element (zero indexed). Returns -1 if the element is not present
	- Insertion: Inserts the element passed to the insert function according to the following criteria:
		+ 1 inserts the element at the start of the linked list
		+ -1 inserts the element at the end of the list
		+ otherwise inserts at the specified position.
		+ returns -1 if the position is out of bounds
	- Deletion: Deletes the element passed to the delete function.
	
- double_ linked_list.c
	+ This program implements the same operations as linked_list.c on a double linked list.

- circular_ linked_list.c
	+ This program implements the same operations as linked_list.c on a circular linked list.

- stack_using_queue.c
	+ This program implements the functionalities of a stack using the queue data structure
	
-  stack_using_queue.c
	+ This program implements the functionalities of a queue using the stack data structure
